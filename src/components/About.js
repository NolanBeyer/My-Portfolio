				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<h4>I've always been really interested in technology, but never thought
				about a career in web development until summer of 2019. I started doing
				some research and just trying to learn some of the basics in HTML and
				CSS. I fell in love with the thought of making this a full time career.
				I've spent countless hours over the last year and although I still have
				a lot to learn I'm really excited for this next step and am willing to
				learn additional technologies to fit the needs of future employers.
